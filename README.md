## BattleKnights
A crypto-native auto battler game that lives entirely on the blockchain - from knight creation to tournament simulation. Using Chainlink VRF to provide verifiable randomness to the blockchain we can ensure fairness for all.

#### Inspiration
I was inspired to experiment by a [tutorial written by Patrick Collins](https://blog.chain.link/build-deploy-and-sell-your-own-dynamic-nft/) exploring dynamic NFTs. The [D&D NFT repo](https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/dungeons-and-dragons-nft) was a starting point in which I am trying to iterate from.
